# Gredo

Gredo is a simple experimental React app designed to help you maintain lists of ToDos and offload them from your brain. The lists are saved using cookies, allowing you to access them across sessions.

## Features

- Create and save multiple lists with custom names
- Offload tasks from your mind by adding them to lists
- Preserve checked status of tasks within each list

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/s7chak/gredo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd gredo
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Usage
Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.
Select a date and time using the date picker.
Press Enter or Return to enter a task.
Optionally, enter a list name for the whole list and save it for future reference.
View any list from the table of lists. The selected list will appear with its checked status preserved.

### Build
To build the app for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a build folder with the optimized and minified production build of the app.
